Definition of Persistence
==========================================================

Persistence is the ability to continue moving forward towards a goal, even in the face of challenges, setbacks, and obstacles. It's the determination and perseverance to keep going despite difficulties that separates high achievers from those who give up too easily.

The Three Components of Persistence
-----------------------------------

1. **Goal-directedness** - Persistence requires a clear vision of what you want to achieve. Without a specific goal in mind, it's difficult to remain focused and motivated when faced with challenges.

2. **Effort** - Achieving goals requires hard work and effort. Persistence involves putting in the necessary time and energy required to reach your objectives.

3. **Time** - Success rarely happens overnight. Persistence involves being patient and willing to put in the time required to achieve your goals, even when progress seems slow or non-existent.

Examples of Persistence

There are countless examples of persistence in history, sports, business, and everyday life. Here are a few examples:

* Thomas Edison failed over a thousand times before finally inventing the light bulb.
* J.K. Rowling was rejected by multiple publishers before finally finding success with the Harry Potter series.

Developing a persistent mindset has numerous benefits, including:
